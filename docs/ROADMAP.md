## Deferred / Under Consideration

### Features We're Considering

**Gameplay:**
- PvP duels
- Cooperative multiplayer dungeons
- Lore and story mode
- NFT breeding/fusion

**Technical:**
- Layer 3 deployment (ultra-low fees)
- Zero-knowledge proofs for hidden information
- Chainlink VRF for provable randomness
- Account abstraction (gasless transactions)

**Economic:**
- Play-to-earn token (with caution)
- NFT staking for passive income
- Deflationary burn mechanics
- Scholarship programs

### Why Deferred?

These features are **not** on the immediate roadmap because:
1. **Complexity**: Adds significant development and testing burden
2. **Risk**: Could destabilize economic model if poorly implemented
3. **Demand Uncertainty**: Need community validation first
4. **Focus**: Prefer to excel at core gameplay first

We will revisit these based on community feedback and market demand.

---

## Development Philosophy

### Principles

1. **Gameplay First**: Fun beats tokenomics every time
2. **Sustainable Economics**: No Ponzi schemes, ever
3. **Community-Driven**: Listen to players, iterate quickly
4. **Transparent Development**: Open-source, documented decisions
5. **Security Over Speed**: Audit before mainnet, always

### Iteration Cycle

```
Community Feedback → Design → Develop → Test → Deploy → Monitor → Repeat
```

**Cadence:**
- Major releases: Quarterly
- Minor updates: Monthly
- Hotfixes: As needed
- Community updates: Weekly
